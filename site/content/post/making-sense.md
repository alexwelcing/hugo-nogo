* We believe that the best way to disseminate this detailed and complex content will be through an interactive web-based product.
* Roadmap content will include text, graphs, and tables.
* We would envision a clickable menu of strategies, where the user would be able to find content organized by topic, and click on individual links to pull content of interest (on the screen, not as a download).
* Sections would embed cross-links to other relevant sections so users do not have to go back to the homepage to navigate to other relevant information.
* Data tables would be embedded as graphics within relevant sections, but also accessible through links taking users straight to the tables.
* The product should be tagged in a way that users can easily search for content.
