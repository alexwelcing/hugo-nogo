  K8s is not an ultimatum forcing the adoption of containers. It is another building block available for developers to build scalable applications faster,
  for less cost. The development community is excited about the implications, but how can you share the opportunity with management for a real life project?

This [week](/wdwdw) we’ll tak a look at a developer experience shipping secure sites using **VS Code, Docker, GCP, GitHub, and Netlify.** This demo is intended to show the versatility available using readily available tools.

Wordpress was launched in 2003 as a fork of an opensource news/weblog tool, B2/cafelog, built on PHP with MYSQL database (db). The Content Management System architecture has shifted in fifteen years, thanks to the rise of cloud services, virtualization, and the enabled preference for microservices/APIs among latest opensource languages.

## React to the changing environment

The 3rd wave of computing  of an hourglass-shaped glass flask with a conical funnel-like neck (rather than the cylindrical neck of an Erlenmeyer flask) and uses proprietary filters, made of bonded paper (thicker-gauge paper than the standard paper filters for a drip-method coffeemaker) that removes most of the coffee oils, brewing coffee with a taste that is different than coffee brewed in other coffee-making systems; also, the thicker paper of the Chemex coffee filters may assist in removing cafestol, a cholesterol-containing compound found in coffee oils. Here’s three important tips newbies forget about:

1. Always buy dedicated Chemex filters.
2. Use a scale, don’t try to eyeball it.
3. Never skip preheating the glass.
4. Timing is key, don’t forget the clock.

The most visually distinctive feature of the Chemex is the heatproof wooden collar around the neck, allowing it to be handled and poured when full of hot water. This is turned, then split in two to allow it to fit around the glass neck. The two pieces are held loosely in place by a tied leather thong. The pieces are not tied tightly and can still move slightly, retained by the shape of the conical glass.

For a design piece that became popular post-war at a time of Modernism and precision manufacture, this juxtaposition of natural wood and the organic nature of a hand-tied knot with the laboratory nature of glassware was a distinctive feature of its appearance.
